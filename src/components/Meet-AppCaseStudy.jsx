      <p>
        The Meet App is a web application designed to help users discover and
        keep track of upcoming events. The app provides various features to
        enhance the user experience, such as filtering events by city,
        showing/hiding event details, specifying the number of events to
        display, offline usage capabilities, adding the app as a shortcut to the
        home screen, and displaying charts to visualize event details. The
        objective of the project is to create a user-friendly platform for event
        discovery and management, leveraging modern web technologies and
        practices.
